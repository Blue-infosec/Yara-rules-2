# About
## What is this?
A repo containing some of my privately developed Yara rules.

## Why?
To contribute to the community.

## Can I use these rules?
Of course! That's why I created this repo. 

You can use them in your detection systems. All rules are TLP:White, so you can use and distribute them freely.

## Minimum Yara version needed?
v3.3.0 is minimally needed, as some rules may require a specific module. Note that it's recommended to always use the latest Yara version as found [here](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/releases)

## Feedback?
If you spot an issue with one of the rules, feel free to submit a PR!
